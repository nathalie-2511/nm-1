            <p><u>Sports </u><br>
              Growing up I was always surrounded by sports. I played soccer most weekends. If we werent at one of my games then we were watching football or soccer depending on the day. During the week if soccer wasn't on then it was a baseball match or basetball match depending on the time of year. I played sports my whole life and continue to do so at Gonzaga in the intamurals league. I love sports because it's a great way to meet people and have with your friends. What better way than to combine them</p>
             <p><u>Shows and Movies</u> <br>
              Another thing we loved to do as a family was watch TV. We had weekly movie nights that were filled with my favorite snacks. My parents and I wouuld give each other recommendations for shows. That has carried on to college as I give all my friends recommendations. We have watch parties for new shows or even movies. It has become a part of my college experience that allows me to spend time with others and share common interest. It allows me to take a step back from school and decompress for more than 30 minutes.</p> 
              <p><u>Exploring with Friends</u> <br>
              Now this is something that has helped me explore Spokane. My friends and I go on hikes to see the unique nature Washington has to offer. Since winter is harsh in Spokane, we try to go as much as possible during the fall. Once winter starts we tend to go on drives or watch the sunset/sunrise. On most drives we tend to stumble upon parks or good view point that is hidden away. This is the perfect way to still explore Spokane wil stayinng warm. We have yet to watch the sunrise but hope to do soon.</p>
